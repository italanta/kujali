## Tech Stack

Our application is built using Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building web and mobile applications, and TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features.

Here is a brief overview of how the application is structured:

- Components: The building blocks of the application, responsible for displaying the UI and handling user interactions. Each component has its own template, styles, and logic, and can be nested inside other components.

- Services: Classes that handle the business logic of the application, such as accessing an API or manipulating data. Services can be injected into components to share functionality across the application.

- Routes: Define the different URLs of the application and which component should be displayed for each route.

- Modules: Group related components, services, and routes together. Each module has its own set of imports, declarations, and exports, which define what should be available to other modules in the application.

- TypeScript: The application uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing, classes, interfaces and other features. That makes the development more robust and reliable.

- Interfaces: are used to define the types of the variables and objects in the application.

- Decorators: are used to add metadata to classes, methods, and properties, which can be used by Angular to configure the application.

- Observables: We use the RxJS library to handle asynchronous data streams, such as HTTP requests and user input. Components can subscribe to observables to receive updates and trigger changes in the UI.


Overall, The application is built with a modular structure, that makes it easy to understand, maintain, and scale. The use of TypeScript and Angular makes it robust and reliable. The application implements best practices for web development, such as separating concerns and using dependency injection, to make the code more maintainable.


## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to setup your project and get running

### Create a Firebase Project

Setting up a Firebase project is a simple process that can be completed in a few steps. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

```
1. Go to the Firebase website <https://firebase.google.com> and sign in to your Google account.

2. Click on the "Go to console" button on the top right corner of the page.

3. Click on the "Create a project" button to create a new project.

4. Fill in the necessary information for the project, such as the name and ID.

5. Select the billing account and enable Google Analytics if you want to use it (Optional).

6. Click on the "Create project" button to create the project.
```

Once the project is created, you will be taken to the dashboard. From here you can add different features to your project, such as 
```
Authentication, Cloud Firestore, Realtime Database, and more.
```

To add a new feature, click on the hamburger icon on the top left corner of the page and select the feature you want to add.

Follow the instructions on the screen to set up the feature.


You can also access the project settings, by clicking on the settings icon on the top left corner of the project dashboard, you will access the settings to add collaborators, and configure the project.

That's it! You now have a Firebase project set up and ready to use. Keep in mind that you may need to configure some settings and add some dependencies to your application to make use of the Firebase features as you'll see in the (Installtion step).

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your environment files (in the Installation step)
This config variables can be found by following the steps below.


`apiKey`: `YOUR_FIREBASE_API-KEY`

`authDomain`: `YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN`

`projectId`: `YOUR_PROJECT_ID`

`storageBucket`: `YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET`

`messagingSenderId`: `YOUR_MESSAGING_ID`

`appId`: `YOUR_APP_ID`

### Add a Web Application to your project

Adding a web application to a Firebase project is a simple process that can be completed in a few steps. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

```
1. Go to the Firebase Console <https://console.firebase.google.com> and select the project that you want to add the web application to.

2. Click on the "Develop" tab in the navigation menu on the left side of the page.

3. Select "Web App" from the options.

4. Click on the "Config" button to get your web app's Firebase configuration object. This object contains the necessary information to connect your web app to your Firebase project.

5. In your web application, create a new file (or add to an existing one) to hold the Firebase configuration object, usually a config.ts or config.js file.

6. Copy and paste the Firebase configuration object into this file and make sure it's available to the rest of your application.

```

## Install and Run Locally

#### Fork & Clone the project

```
1. Go to the Kujali repository <https://github.com/italanta/kujali> on Github.
2. Click on the "Fork" button located on the top right corner of the page.
3. Select the account you want to fork the repository to (Once the fork is complete, you will be redirected to your newly forked repository.)
4. Clone the forked repository to your local machine by copying the "clone" URL and running "git clone [URL]" in your command line.

```

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:italanta/kujali.git
```

### Setup project environments
Open the project with your prefered IDE (VS Code, Sublime, e.t.c)

You need to add the environment config to your app to connect to firebase, follow the steps below:

```
1. Create a folder called environments inside -> app/kujali/src
2. Create a file called environment.ts inside this folder
3. Create a file called environment.prod.ts inside this folder
```

Once you've created the files above copy the firebase config and paste inside each file.

Your environment.ts file should contain a firebase object similar to the one below:

```typescript
export const environment = {

  production : false,
  useEmulators: true,

  firebase: {
    apiKey: "YOUR_API-KEY",
    authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
    messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_ID",
    appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
  },

  project: {
    name: 'YOUR_PROJECT_NAME'
  }
}
```

Your environment.prod.ts file should contain a firebase object similar to the one below:

```typescript
export const environment = {

  production : true,
  useEmulators: false,

  firebase: {
    apiKey: "YOUR_API-KEY",
    authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
    messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_ID",
    appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
  },

  project: {
    name: 'YOUR_PROJECT_NAME'
  }
}
```

Your app is now almost ready to connect to firebase.
